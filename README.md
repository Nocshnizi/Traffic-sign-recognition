# Traffic Sign Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The system can:
- Train a model from scratch on GTSRB images
- Classify traffic signs in real-time using a webcam
- Achieve >95% accuracy on test data

## Dataset
**GTSRB Dataset** (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark):
- 43 classes of traffic signs
- 39,209 training images
- 12,630 test images
- Image size: 32x32 pixels (resized)

Class labels available in [class_names.py](class_names.py)
